# 🔐 Duplicate Prevention System - Complete Solution

## 📊 Problem Analysis

**Initial State:**
- Total records in database: 18,072
- Unique transactions: 9,536
- Duplicate records: 8,536 (each transaction appeared exactly 2x)
- Root cause: Import system allowed same data to be imported multiple times

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. **Database-Level Protection (Primary Defense)**

#### A. Unique Hash Column
Created a computed hash column that automatically generates a unique fingerprint for each transaction:

```sql
-- Hash is computed from these fields (case-insensitive, trimmed):
- date (day only, ignoring time)
- value (transaction amount)
- name (client name)
- depositor (who made the deposit)
- car (vehicle information)
- payment_method (payment type)
```

#### B. Database Trigger
Automatic trigger that computes the hash on INSERT/UPDATE:
- Runs before every insert/update
- Normalizes data (lowercase, trim whitespace)
- Creates MD5 hash of combined fields
- Stored in `duplicate_check_hash` column

#### C. Unique Constraint
Added database constraint: `transactions_unique_hash`
- Prevents insertion of records with duplicate hash
- Database-level enforcement (cannot be bypassed)
- Returns error code `23505` when duplicate detected

**Files Modified:**
- Migration: `supabase/migrations/add_unique_constraint_transactions.sql`

### 2. **Application-Level Detection (Secondary Defense)**

#### A. Enhanced Duplicate Detection Function
Location: `src/lib/parsers.ts` - `detectDuplicates()`

**Features:**
1. **Internal Duplicate Detection**: Removes duplicates within the same import batch
2. **Database Comparison**: Compares new transactions against ALL existing records
3. **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly which duplicates were found and skipped

**Process:**
```typescript
1. Load all existing transactions from database
2. Create hash keys from existing data
3. Detect internal duplicates in import batch
4. Filter out duplicates with database
5. Return only unique transactions
```

#### B. Robust Import Handler
Location: `src/components/GoogleSheetsConnectionServiceAccount.tsx`

**Features:**
1. **Batch Processing**: Imports in batches of 100 for performance
2. **Error Recovery**: If database detects duplicates, falls back to individual inserts
3. **Accurate Counting**: Tracks exactly how many were imported vs. skipped
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with estimated time

**Error Handling:**
- Catches database duplicate errors (code `23505`)
- Attempts individual inserts for failed batches
- Continues import process without failing
- Reports all duplicates skipped (application + database level)

### 3. **Data Cleanup**

#### Cleanup Script Used
```sql
-- Identified duplicate groups
-- Kept the oldest record (by created_at)
-- Deleted all subsequent duplicates
-- Result: 18,072 → 9,536 records
```

**Verification:**
- Before cleanup: 18,072 records
- After cleanup: 9,536 unique records
- Duplicates removed: 8,536

## 🎯 Duplicate Detection Criteria

A transaction is considered a duplicate if **ALL** of the following match:

| Field | Normalization | Weight |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Date | Ignores time, uses date only | Required |
| Value | Exact match (2 decimal places) | Required |
| Name | Lowercase, trimmed | Required |
| Depositor | Lowercase, trimmed | Required |
| Car | Lowercase, trimmed | Required |
| Payment Method | Lowercase, trimmed | Required |

## 🔍 How to Verify the Solution

### Test 1: Import Same Sheet Twice
```bash
1. Import your Google Sheet (9,546 rows)
   Expected: 9,536 unique records imported

2. Import the same sheet again
   Expected: 0 new records, 9,536 duplicates skipped
```

### Test 2: Check Database Constraint
```sql
-- This query should FAIL with error 23505:
INSERT INTO transactions (date, value, name, depositor, car, payment_method, source, status)
VALUES
  ('2023-05-15', '223.00', 'Melissa Gabriela', NULL, '2013 Ford Explorer', 'Zelle', 'Test', 'pending-ledger');
```

### Test 3: Verify Unique Hash
```sql
-- Check all records have hash computed:
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(duplicate_check_hash) as with_hash,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(duplicate_check_hash) as missing_hash
FROM transactions;

-- Expected result: missing_hash = 0
```

## 🛡️ Protection Layers

The system now has **3 layers** of duplicate protection:

### Layer 1: Application Detection (First Line)
- Detects duplicates during import processing
- Compares against existing database records
- Removes internal duplicates within import batch
- Fast and efficient (uses Set for O(1) lookup)

### Layer 2: Database Constraint (Fail-Safe)
- Enforced at database level
- Cannot be bypassed by application
- Automatic hash computation via trigger
- Prevents any duplicate insertion

### Layer 3: Error Recovery (Graceful Handling)
- Catches duplicate errors from database
- Falls back to individual inserts
- Provides detailed logs
- Continues processing without failing entire import

## 📈 Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: Hash computation is fast (MD5)
- **Efficient**: Trigger runs only on INSERT/UPDATE
- **Scalable**: Works with 9,000+ records without issues
- **No slowdown**: Batch processing maintains speed

## 🔧 Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Monitoring
```sql
-- Check for duplicate attempts (should be in logs):
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
  MAX(created_at) as last_import
FROM transactions;
```

### Weekly Verification
```sql
-- Verify no duplicates exist:
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(DISTINCT duplicate_check_hash) as unique_hashes,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(DISTINCT duplicate_check_hash) as potential_duplicates
FROM transactions;

-- Expected: potential_duplicates = 0
```

### Monthly Audit
```sql
-- Review import history:
SELECT
  import_started_at::date as import_date,
  COUNT(*) as imports,
  SUM(records_imported) as total_imported,
  SUM(duplicates_skipped) as total_skipped
FROM import_history
WHERE import_started_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY import_started_at::date
ORDER BY import_date DESC;
```

## 🚨 Error Messages You Might See

### "Database detected duplicates that passed application filter"
**Meaning**: The database caught duplicates that the app didn't detect
**Action**: This is NORMAL - the database is doing its job as a safety net
**Result**: Import continues, duplicates are skipped

### "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Meaning**: Attempting to insert a duplicate transaction
**Action**: Automatic recovery - transaction is skipped
**Result**: Import completes successfully
