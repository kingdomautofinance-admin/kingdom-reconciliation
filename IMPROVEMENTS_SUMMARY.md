### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Restructured "Selected for Match" Section ✅

- Maintained consistent field order matching the main transaction cards:
  - Date
  - Client / Depositor
  - Car
  - Method
  - Amount
  - Status (added to match section)
  - Source
- Improved visual hierarchy with better spacing (`space-y-2`, `gap-3`)
- Changed from 6-column to 7-column grid to include Status field

**User Experience Impact:**
